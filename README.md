# MATH 5650 - Nonlinear Optimization Project

This project simulates particle swarm optimization as well as standard nonlinear optimization algorithms (steepest descent, Newton's method, BFGS) in both constrained and unconstrained settings. The program contains a set of objective functions to evaluate each method on, to emphasize their respective strengths and weaknesses.
