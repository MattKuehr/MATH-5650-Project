DEMONSTRATION

-Demonstrate PSO in action on Rastrigin function (unonstrained)
>Change w
>Change c1
>Change c2

-Demonstrate PSO on Rosenbrock function (constrained)

-Demonstrate PSO on non-differentiable functions (unconstrained)

VERSUS

-Demonstrate PSO vs standard methods on strictly convex function (unconstrained) (worse)

-Demonstrate PSO vs standard methods on Rastrigin function (unconstrained) (better)

-Demonstrate PSO vs standard methods on non-convex function (unconstrained) (better)
