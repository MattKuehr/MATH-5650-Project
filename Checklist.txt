DEMONSTRATION

-Demonstrate PSO in action on Rastrigin function (unonstrained)
>Change w
>Change c1
>Change c2

-Demonstrate PSO on Rosenbrock function (constrained)

-Demonstrate PSO on non-differentiable functions (unconstrained)
f(x,y) = \frac{-1}{\ciel{\sqrt{x^2 +y^2}}}

VERSUS

-Demonstrate PSO vs standard methods on strictly convex function (unconstrained) (worse)
e^{x^2 + y^2} + ln(1 + x^2 + y^2)

-Demonstrate PSO vs standard methods on Rastrigin function (unconstrained) (better)

-Demonstrate PSO vs standard methods on non-convex function (unconstrained) (better)
x^2 + y^2 - 1(x^2 + y^2 -1)^2

-Demonstrate PSO vs standard methods on Rastrigin function (unconstrained) (better)
